# My custom `.keylayout` files

This repository contains customized QWERTY keyboard layout in `.keylayout` format, for use on OS X.

## Customization details

I’ve found that Developers/DevOps productivity is increased by using US keyboard layouts, specially for the location of the keys: `-`, `/`, `=` and `~` at one single key stroke distance and physical position. So getting a new computer with a Spanish keyboard can affect your Developing skills.

This is a `Spanish - ISO .keylayout` with those keys exactly in the same position as in a US keyboard, leaving all the rest of they keys in the original `Spanish - ISO` layout position, (all the removed keys are still accesible using `alt`).

## How to install a new keyboard layout

1. Copy the `.keylayout` file to the `Keyboard Layouts` folder within `/Library` or `~/Library`.
2. Reboot, or log out and log in again.
3. Enable the new keyboard layout via _System Preferences_ › _Language & Text_ › _Input Sources_.

OS X has supported `.keylayout` files since version 10.2 (Jaguar).
